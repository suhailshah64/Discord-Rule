</div>

> Welcome to the TyramiteZone Discord Server! To keep this community fun, respectful, and safe for everyone, please read and follow the rules below. Violations may lead to mute/kick/ban depending on severity. Common sense is expected.



**#1** — Be Kind & Respectful

Respect all members — toxic behavior, harassment, or personal attacks will not be tolerated. Treat others the way you'd like to be treated.



**#2** — Keep It Clean & Friendly

No NSFW, hate speech, harassment, or offensive jokes (racism, homophobia, pedophilia, etc.).
Instant ban if violated — no warnings.



**#3** — No Politics or Religious Debates

Keep controversial or divisive topics away from the server. This isn’t the place for those discussions.



**#4** — Use a Proper Username

Inappropriate names, impersonation, or offensive statuses are not allowed. Staff may change your name or take further action.



**#5** — No Spam or Flooding

Avoid message spam, emoji spam, mic spam in VC, or unnecessary tagging.
Do not argue with mods about what counts as spam.



**#6** — Respect Other Creators

No hate or drama about other YouTubers or streamers. We support healthy content culture.



**#7** — English or Hindi Only

To help moderators, use only **English or Hindi** in public channels. Using other languages may result in a warning or kick.


**#8** — Discord’s Minimum Age Policy

Users under **13 years old** will be banned, as per Discord Terms of Service.



**#9** — Maintain a Safe Environment

No triggering, violent, or illegal content allowed. Let’s make this server a safe space for everyone.



**#10** — Follow Staff Instructions

Don’t argue with moderators or admins. Their word is final during moderation. Disrespect = mute/kick/ban.



**#11** — Obey Discord’s Terms

Follow the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) at all times.
